            \Delta y = v_0t+\frac{1}{2}at^2= 0+ \frac{1}{2}(\frac{49}{30})(2)^2 = \frac{49}{15} \approx 3.27 m

    A crane and box are initially at rest. At time $t=0$, the crane begins to drive forward at a constant speed of $0.5 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}$ , while also lifting the box with an upward acceleration of 1 \ms. The box does not swing by the crane. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Draw a FBD, that represents the forces acting on the box.
        \item Using graph-paper sketch the shape of the path taken by the box as it is lifted by the crane as it is viewed by a stationary observer.
        \item Justify the shape of the path you drew above. 
        \item Assume that at $t=0$, the horizontal position of the box is $x=0$ and it has a vertical position of $y=0$. Derive an equation that describes the vertical position $y$ of the box as a function of the horizontal position $x$ of the box.
        \item Does your equation from part (d) agree with your sketch in part (b)? Justify your answer. 
    \end{enumerate}

    \item The block takes $t_{\text{up}}$ to slide up the ramp a distance of $x$. The block then takes $t_{\text{down}}$ to slid back down to the bottom of the ramp, where it has a speed $v_f$. Is $t_{\text{down}}$ greater than, equal to, or less than $t_{\text{up}}$?

A group of students is investigating how the thickness of a plastic rod affects the maximum force $F_{\text{max}}$ with which the rod can be pulled without breaking. Two students are discussing models to represent how $F_{\text{max}}$ depends on rod thickness. Student $A$ claims that $F_{\text{max}}$ is directly proportional to the radius of the rod. Student $B$ claims that $F_{\text{max}}$ is directly proportional to the cross-sectional area of the rodâthe area of the base of the cylinder, shaded gray in the figure above.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The students have a collection of many rods of the same material. The rods are all the same length but come in a range of six different thicknesses. Design an experimental procedure to determine which studentâs model, if either, correctly represents how $F_{\text{max}}$ depends on rod thickness.\\\\
    In the table below, list the quantities that would be measured in your experiment. Define a symbol to represent each quantity, and also list the equipment that would be used to measure each quantity. You do not need to fill in every row. If you need additional rows, you may add them to the space just below the table.

Describe the overall procedure to be used, referring to the table. Provide enough detail so that another student could replicate the experiment, including any steps necessary to reduce experimental uncertainty. As needed, use the symbols defined in the table and/or include a simple diagram of the setup.

\item For a rod of radius $r_0$, it is determined that $F_{\text{max}}$ is $F_0$, as indicated by the dot on the grid below. On the grid, draw and label graphs corresponding to the two studentsâ models of the dependence of $F_{\text{max}}$ on rod radius. Clearly label each graph $A$ or $B$, corresponding to the appropriate model.
